vimrc
=====

Why man
-------
All the cool kids put their vimrc online. It's 20x6 and you haven't?

Tell me your secrets
--------------------
You got your usual noise:
*General stuff to act like a text editor from the '90s and beyond
*Syntax coloring
*Tabs for indentation, spaces for formatting within a block
*tab length of four, except for ASM where it's eight
*A sick pilcrow character
*Mash F5 to kill off whitspace so your reviewers don't have an aneurysm
*Case insensitive search mostly

For who
-------
The secret is I'm a "bad vim user" - I don't have tens of extensions and a package manager for them. I like the mouse and spend lots of time in insert mode. I make up for this efficiency deficit by probably being faster at typing than you.

Your vimrc sucks
